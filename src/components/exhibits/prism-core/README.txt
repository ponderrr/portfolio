EXHIBIT 002 — PRISM CORE

Purpose:
A pinned, scroll-scrubbed 3D experience showcasing a premium faceted crystal (“instrument”) that ignites,
aligns an energy beam, locks into refractive alignment with a brief dispersion moment, then settles.

Key principles:
- Legible cinematic sequence
- No big overlay UI: tiny dock only
- Dark, restrained palette (indigo/cyan accents)
- Mobile fallback (touch simplified)
- prefers-reduced-motion supported
